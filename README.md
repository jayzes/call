# A Collection of CFP Responses, Talk Ideas, and Proposals

Following [Brandon Keepers](https://github.com/bkeepers/cfp)' lead, I thought it'd be a cool idea to start a repo
with some talk ideas and submissions to keep better track of them, as
well as to get them out in the open. Who knows, maybe some of these are
more interesting or can be executed better by others?
